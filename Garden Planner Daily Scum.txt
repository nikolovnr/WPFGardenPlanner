/////Monday: September 12, 2016/////
Nathalie:
1- I did the plant & beds menus on the ribbon. I started to take care of companion plants since I did not have access to Internet for a while and could do that easily. I started the Login window too.
2- I will learn how to drag and drop from the ribbon buttons. If time allows it, I will start to use it for one bed size (3x3).
3- I will definitely need help about this matter. I will see with my best friend, Google.

Nikolay:
1- I managed to draw filled rectangles on canvas, save the image on file and show predifined print dialog box.

3- I need help with GitHub SourceTree resolving conflicts.


/////Tuesday: September 13, 2016/////
Nathalie:
1- I tried to find a solution on Google to drag a Button from Ribbon onto Canvas.
2- I still have to learn about drag and drop.
3- This time, I need to look about it with Nikolay The Great.

Nikolay:
1- I looked to rebuild the container to use a grid instead of canvas.
2- I will make the garden schema to use a grid with images for plants in cells.
3- I need help to reorganize the database, so to use grid cells.


/////Wednesday: September 14, 2016/////
Nathalie:

2- I will finish to implement Nikolay solution with the rest of buttons.
3- If I need help, I will see with Nikolay the Great.

Nikolay:
1- Found a solution for seeding plants (put images on grid), save garden as image (hardcoded file garden.png), print garden.
2- I will work on data model of the garden and Database class.
3- Nathalie will help me to rebuild the database so to be able to save the garden information from the grid.
